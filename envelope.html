      <h2>To the one who will always hold a special place in my heart.</h2>
      <p><b>Hey Pratikshya, howâ€™s everything with you? Iâ€™m not sure if you still check this, but if you do,
         hereâ€™s something I wrote something I never found the courage to say out loud. These are the feelings
          I wanted to share with you, but couldnâ€™t. I wrote this on April 4, 2025. I donâ€™t know when youâ€™ll 
          read it, or if weâ€™ll still be friends by then, but still... here it is.</b></p>


      <p>These felling i have for you sometime i think why does this always happen to me? Why do I always
         end up holding on to feelings that only bring me pain? The love I once had for you it was real,
          it was deep, and it made me believe in something beautiful. But now, that same love feels like
           a wound that never heals. I wish I could just turn it off, let it fade away like a bad dream.</p>

      <p>I know you donâ€™t love me. Iâ€™ve felt it for a while now. But then you smile at me and that smile
         confuses everything. For a split second, when our eyes meet, all the resentment, all the pain,
          all the questionsâ€¦ they vanish. And in that moment, I just want to be near you. To talk to you. 
          To laugh with you. To forget everything else and just exist in that small space with you.</p>
      
      <p>I know I havenâ€™t been perfect either. I stopped messaging you the way I used to. Maybe itâ€™s because
         every time I did, I was left waiting sometimes for hours just to get a reply. And that wait? It made
          me feel like I didnâ€™t matter. Like I was justâ€¦ someone you talked to when there was nothing else to do.
           That kind of silence speaks louder than words, you know?</p>
      
      <p>All I ever wanted was something simple, something real. I wanted us to be there for each other,
         to be the first person we turned to when life hit hard or when something beautiful happened.
          I wanted to know everything about you how was your day, what did you eat, how you were as a kid,
           your happiest memories, your darkest days and why you fought with your sister. I want to listen
            to all this stuff.</p>
      
      <p>I wanted you to know all of me too. My thoughts, my silly rants, even the stuff that makes no sense to
         anyone else. I wanted you to hear it all and still stay. I wanted us to explore the world together,
          to experience new places, new cultures, to make memories in foreign cities and hold hands in unfamiliar
           streets.</p>
      
      <p>But somewhere along the way, I realizedâ€¦ that dream wasnâ€™t ours. It was mine. You never really wanted 
        that with me.</p>
      
      <p>And yet, despite everything, I still wait. I wait for your name to pop up on my screen.
         For that one message. For that one call. I know it rarely comes, but still my heart always hopes. 
         Silly, right?</p>
      
      <p>I donâ€™t even know what you think of me. I know Iâ€™m not the kind of guy you dream of. 
        Iâ€™m probably not even close. But you just the sight of you used to light something in me.
         You made me feel like maybe I could be enough. But now, all that light feels like itâ€™s fading.</p>
      
      <p>Still, I donâ€™t hate you. I never could. I just hate this feeling, this ache that wonâ€™t go away.
        This love that stuck around far longer than it ever should have. But if every a time come to choose 
        i would choose you over everbody.</p>
      
      <p>Maybe youâ€™ll never read this. Maybe none of it will ever matter to you. But if by any chance
         these words ever reach youâ€¦ just know this:</p>
      
      <p>I love you <b>Ma ChÃ©rie</b>.<br>
      and still do this day.</p>
      <br>

      <hr>
      <p>And if you're reading this and weâ€™ve become stranger, then I just want you to know I could never
         hate you. Please, be the happiest you can be. Take care of yourself, love yourself a little more 
         every day, and chase everything that makes your heart full. Iâ€™ll always treasure the memories we 
         shared, no matter where life takes us. Iâ€™ll be silently cheering for you from afar, wishing you 
         nothing but happiness and praying for all the good things to find you.</p>
        <br>
      <hr>
      <p>And if youâ€™re reading this and somehow weâ€™re still in each otherâ€™s lives... then thank you.
         Thank you for staying. Thank you for not running away (even though I probably made it very
         tempting at times). I hope we are making crazy memories, keep laughing until we canâ€™t breathe,
          and keep choosing each other, even when life gets messy. Iâ€™ll always be grateful for you, 
          no matter what the future holds.<b> love you Ma ChÃ©rie</b></p>
